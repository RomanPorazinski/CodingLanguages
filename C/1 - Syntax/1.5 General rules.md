# Syntax rules
## Variable naming
### Naming conventions
There are different styles of naming conventions which need to be picked. 
1) CamelCapitalisationOfEveryName
2) Spacing_option_for_legibility
3) littleCamelCapitalsation (first word starts with small letter)

My preference is option 1.

Regardless of which style you pick from the ones available above, you should also add a prefix to define the data type of the used variable to allow for easier code integration and reduce type mismatches

| Prefix | Data Type        |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| b      | boolean          |
| f      | float            |
| u      | unsigned integer |
| s      | signed integer   |
| d      | double           |
If you are working with pointers then you would add a p before the above prefix so that the user know what kind of a pointer it is i.e:
	piCowCountInField -> pointer to an integer storing the number of cows counted on the field
You can also follow the F1 naming convention when creating diagnostic signals to be displayed.

| Prefix | Use case                     |
| ------ | ---------------------------- |
| t      | time/time period             |
| h      | height (flight/altitude)     |
| x      | displacement (usually in mm) |
| s      | distance moved/travelled     |
| v      | velocity                     |
| n      | angular velocity (rpm)       |
| f      | frequncy                     |
| a      | angle                        |
| m      | mass                         |
| M      | Torque                       |
| F      | Force (N)                    |
| p      | Pressure                     |
| P      | Power (W)                    |
| r      | Ratio/Duty cycle             |
| q      | Flow rate                    |

### Reusing names across different scopes
The same variable name can be used in the code and won't croscontaminate the functionality as long as you understand the scope in which it exists. In the example below, you can see a lot of same variables that are called
```c
int main(void)
{
[1] -> //scope 1
int j;
f(5);
printf("%d\n", j);
return 0
}

void f(int i) {
[2] -> //scope 2
int j = 1;
printf("i at the start of function is %d\n", i);
i++;
printf("i after increment is %d\n", i);
for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++){
	[3] -> // scope 3
    int j = 2;
    printf("j is now %d\n", j);
    printf("i is now %d\n", i);
}
printf("j after the for loop is %d\n", j);
printf("i after the for loop is %d\n", i);
}
```
The code above has been divided into 3 scopes, all using the same variables i and j. The above code delivers the following content in the terminal:
```txt
i at the start of function is 5 [Scope 2]
i after increment is 6 [Scope 2]
j is now 2 [Scope 3]
i is now 0 [Scope 3]
j is now 2 [Scope 3]
i is now 1 [Scope 3]
j after the for loop is 1 [Scope 2]
i after the for loop is 6 [Scope 2]
0 [Scope 1]
```
1) i is first equal to the function argument and then gets incremented
2) We enter the for loop after that and i is initialised to a 0 as a loop counter. j is consistently set to 2 during the for loop
3) Once the for loop is done, the variables i and j have the same values they had before the for loop so j=1 and i=6. For loop had its own scope
4) In the end, after the function f was executed, j in Scope 1 has never been initiated so it returned a 0 despite all the events inside of the function
This only works for **sub function** and **for loops** and not for *if statements* or *while loops*

### Understanding Storage Duration
This looks into how long a variables is stored for - how long can it be accessed after work is done with it.

*Difference* between Scope and Storage is that Scope refers to the **presence of a certain variable name** referring to some function whereas the Storage defines how long the **value** exists for



#### Automatic
This is the default way. A variable is defined in a scope (as described above) and the variable only exist throughout the execution of the scope. After a for loop has been completed, you cannot access the variable anymore.

The same happens when executing inside of a function. You can parse variable as arguments but everything that is done with the parsed function will be lost once the function is completed.




#### Static
This ensures that the value can be accessed throughout the whole code execution (doesn't mean anywhere though). The function knows which variables will be used and therefore pre-allocated memory slots

If you define variables in your file scope (main function) then they will be static by default as you never leave the function main

If you define a static variable inside of a function, then every time you revisit this function, the static variables will maintain the last value assigned to them
```c
// Main function
int main(void)
{
    static int i = 1;
    printf("Value of i before function call %d\n", i);
    for (int f = 0; f < 3; f++)
    {
        increment(i);
    }
    printf("Value of i after function call %d\n", i);
    return 0;
}
// function with static
void increment(int i){
static unsigned int uCounter = 0;
uCounter++;
i++;
printf("This is the counter value %d\n", uCounter);
printf("This is the value of i: %d\n", i);
}
```
In the above example, *i* in the file scope will remain 1 despite anything that is done inside of the increment function. the uCounter maintains its value everytime the function is called
```txt
Value of i before function call 1
This is the counter value 1
This is the value of i: 2
This is the counter value 2
This is the value of i: 3
This is the counter value 3
This is the value of i: 4
Value of i after function call 1
```
You can even create a new static with the same name as a static outside the function scope and the outcome will be similar (not that now the value of *i* is carried over for each function call)
```c
void increment(void){
static unsigned int uCounter = 0; // This will initialise at first function call
static int i = 1;
uCounter++;
i++;
printf("This is the counter value %d\n", uCounter);
printf("This is the value of i: %d\n", i);
}
```
The output shows how *static i* is modulated inside of the increment function but remains unchanged inside
```txt
Value of i before function call 1
This is the counter value 1
This is the value of i: 2
This is the counter value 2
This is the value of i: 3
This is the counter value 3
This is the value of i: 4
Value of i after function call 1
```



#### Thread
For multi-thread processors, you can define variables that are only available within a specific thread and not reachable from other threads. Mainly used in *concurrent programming*

```c
_Thread_local unsigned int seed;
// This will be available only in the Thread where this function is being evaluated
// Supported from C11 onwards
```
#### Allocated



### Alignment requirements of objects
Memory within an MCU will have a specified length (8, 16, 32bit)
Different data types will take a certain number of these memory slots therefore to align all the data stored, there are restrictions where can you store each variable

You can force certain memory allocations using #malloc (memory allocation) or #alignof 

TO LOOK MORE INTO - SAMPLE CODE

```C
struct S {

int i; double d; char c; };

int main(void) {

unsigned char bad_buff[sizeof(struct S)];

_Alignas(struct S) unsigned char good_buff[sizeof(struct S)];

struct S *bad_s_ptr = (struct S *)bad_buff; // wrong pointer alignment

struct S *good_s_ptr = (struct S *)good_buff; // correct pointer alignment }
```
