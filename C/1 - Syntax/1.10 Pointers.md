Pointers are memory address indicators which rather than hold a value in the local memory, point the code at the exact location in the memory stack.

As the memory stack will always have the same bit count (depending on the system, this might be 8, 32, 64bi) all pointers will have the same size and therefore are easier to package. There are also pointer types to indicate how many memory slots would need to be read in order to get a full picture.
	For example, a word is a 16 bit variable. In an 8-bit system, this would require to read 2 consecutive memory locations to get the full 16-bit number. The pointer type stores that information
```C
//test
```


### Parsing pointers into a function

When defining a function to take pointers as arguments, you can do it as follows
```C
// function declaration
void swap(int*, int*);

// function implementation
void swap(*pApples, *pPears) {
	...
}
// This function would be called like such
swap(&inputA, &inputB); // & will extract the address of variable
```
The above method allows the function to edit variables outside of it's scope.
