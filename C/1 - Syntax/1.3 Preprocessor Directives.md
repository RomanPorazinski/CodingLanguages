To aid compilation and code clarity, you can write code which the compiler will perform before any of the source code is assembled and compiled. These action might include:
- Enable certain code section through preprocessor if statements
- Substitute a preprocessor variable with a defined number determined at the time of compilation 
		i.e lets say you have the same code intended for hardware with 2 or 4 LEDs, you can have the code use a preprocessor variable LED_COUNT which you define at the time of compilation once you know what hardware you are compiling for
- Determine memory addresses if you want to force a specific memory allocation


## Macro Definitions
Used to assign values to pre-processor variables
```C
#define EXAMPLE_VARIABLE 1
```
This above command will look for all calls of EXAMPLE_VARIABLE in the code and substitute it with a 1 just before code assembly
