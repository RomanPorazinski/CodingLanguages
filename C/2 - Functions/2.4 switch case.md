Switch case is also a way to add conditions in your code. Rather than looking at conditions (> < == ) you can predefine states that can be selected in the switch case to follow a certain path. 

When executing a state machine, you would have the sequence of action specified in a switch-case statement and then increment the switch selector to proceed through the state machine blocks

```c
int choice = 2;

switch (choice) {
    case 1:
        printf("You chose 1\n"); // C
        // std::cout << "You chose 1\n"; // C++
        break;
    case 2:
        printf("You chose 2\n");
        break;
    case 3:
        printf("You chose 3\n");
        break;
    default:
        printf("Invalid choice\n");
}
```

In the above example, focus is brought on *break* as it will force the code to leave the switch state at the end of the sub function completed execution

*default* option will be entered in an event when the value of 'choice' does not match any 'case'

You can also group multiple classes together apparently
```C
switch (choice) {
    case 1:
    case 2:
        printf("You chose 1 or 2\n");
        break;
    case 3:
        printf("You chose 3\n");
        break;
}
```
