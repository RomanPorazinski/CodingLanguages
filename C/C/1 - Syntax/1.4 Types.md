Types a objects in C environment that define how many bits of space will the contents of the specified objects will take. By having these standardised, it is easier to package them around memory.

A *type* helps us **interpret** the bit configuration

## Declaring variables of a certain type

Declares a variable *src* which is a pointer to a char, *c* is a variable of type *char*
```c
char *src, c;
```
You can also define inline single or arrays of the same data type. Below you will get an *x* of type *int* and an array *y* with 5 slots available
```c
int x, y[5];
```
This can be expanded to larger arrays. This creates an array *n* which has 15 rows and 3 columns. The below definition says that n has 15 instances of 3-element vectors thus creating a 2-d array
```c
int n[15][3], o[21];
```
