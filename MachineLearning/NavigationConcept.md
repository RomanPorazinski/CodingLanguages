In the vault, I'd like to have the theoretical concepts defined within the first set of folders where different sub-topics are expanded on from the theoretical point of view.

I think there will be a lot of code which can be used across all fields and so I'd like the code to be defined in the Code Snips folder and then linked to the correct section.
