Depending on the side of  [[Game Trees]], you need to pick a strategy to conquer all the different options available to you. 

## Exploring procedures
### breadth first
For a given position in the system, there is a certain number of option that you can take, whether it is moving a chess piece to a different position (moves are limited) or whether this is moving your actual troops to a different position on the battlefield (you are limited with how far they can move given available time) and in which direction.

In this procedure, you write out all the different option you have from the instant-present position. This is called exploring Level 1 (the current moment is always Level 0). Once you are done then you can proceed with exploring all the option available from the new position defined in Level 1 thus creating Level 2

In the image you can imagine the 11, 22, 112 being Level 1 and now you start investigating the third row
To explore the whole tree you would need: *number of explored Levels^number of successor per node*

### depth-first
In this procedure you focus on fully exploring each option in Level 1 before continuing to the next one. In battlefield terms, you can explore that if you proceed with a certain path, you can reach a strategic point within a certain amount of time. 

There needs to be a **border condition** which captures how far you would like to investigate into the 'future'

This means that by the end of developing the tree, you have a more educated set of information as to how a decision would prove out in the long term

### Search Procedures
Here is an overview of different ways you might take to explore the trees in order to find the outcome you want in the most efficient way
